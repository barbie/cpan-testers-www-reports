To see examples for this distribution, it is recommended you look in the 
following directories:

* ./vhost/cgi-bin
* ./vhost/toolkit

In these directories are the scripts used to run the CPAN Testers Reports
website. Not just the main CGI scripts, but also the various scripts to help
create and manage the site.

I may add further examples should the need ever arise. If you have any example
scripts that use the distribution in an unusual way or make good use of all the
features available, please feel free to submit one. If submitting an example
script, please sure to include the following in your POD:

* Author
* License
* Copyright

Thanks,
Barbie.
