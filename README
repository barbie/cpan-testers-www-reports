NAME
       CPAN::Testers::WWW::Reports - The CPAN Testers Reports website.

DESCRIPTION
       This distribution contains all the code used to run the CPAN Testers
       Reports website.

VHOST FILES
       The CPAN Testers Reports website is built on top of the Labyrinth 
       Website Management System. As such, the code to drive the website is 
       contained within the Labyrinth and associated plugin prerequisites. In 
       order to define the website in terms of functionality, layout and style,
       the files within the './vhost' directory of this distribution should be
       installed into your web server's virtual host directory.

       Included in the distribution is a "vhost.conf" file, which contains the
       virtual host settings to implement the site using the Apache Web
       Server.
